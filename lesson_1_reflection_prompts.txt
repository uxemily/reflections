How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It let me focus in on only the lines of code that differed from each other.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It would be easier to roll back to a previous version if needed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: you control the logic behind the commits, which can help other developers
    cons: you might forget

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because the files can be closely related and you might change something that impacts multiple files. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the commit history of files. git diff followed by two commit ids will show the differences between two files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because it's easy to roll back to a previous version, so there's not much risk.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

   mostly just this course, but also potentially collaborating with a developer
